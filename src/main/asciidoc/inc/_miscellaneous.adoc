=== How does the redeploy work

During the _initialize_ phase, the plugin starts observing the mojos (Maven plugins) that are executed.
When the Vert.x application is launched, it watches for changes in `src/main`.
When a file is changed (created, updated or deleted), it replays the executed mojos.
It executes all the mojos from the _generate-sources_ to the _process-classes_ phases, using the same configuration as the initial (observed) one.

When these mojos are executed, they may update files in `target/classes`.
The Vert.x application has been launched to observe changed files from this location and restart when changes happen.
The application is restarted completely, _i.e._ stopped and restarted.

Such mechanism lets you use any Maven plugin (executed in the right set of phase).
The plugin is re-executed and then the Vert.x application is restarted.
